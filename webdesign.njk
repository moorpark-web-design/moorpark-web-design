    <h2>Custom Code, No Page Builders</h2>
    <p>
      At Ventura Coast Web Design, we believe in building websites the right way—by hand. We never use page builders or WordPress templates. Every site is crafted from scratch, giving you a unique, high-performance website with zero bloat, instant load times, and bulletproof security. Our approach means you get a site that stands out, loads fast, and is built to last for years without constant updates or plugin headaches.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Custom Code Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faster Load Times:</strong> Our sites load in under a second, so you never lose visitors to slow pages. Studies show that if your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, you could lose up to 50% of your traffic. We make sure that never happens.</li>
      <li><strong>Better Conversions:</strong> Fast, user-friendly websites keep visitors engaged and turn more clicks into customers. A smooth experience means more leads and sales for your business.</li>
      <li><strong>Superior Ad Performance:</strong> Google rewards fast sites with lower ad costs and higher quality scores. Our optimized code helps you get more from your ad budget and improves your ROI.</li>
      <li><strong>Unmatched Security:</strong> No databases, no plugins, no server-side vulnerabilities. Our static sites are virtually impossible to hack, so you can rest easy knowing your business is safe online.</li>
      <li><strong>SEO That Works:</strong> Google loves fast, well-structured websites. Our custom builds help you climb the search rankings, attract more visitors, and boost your Google Business Profile visibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Reliability:</strong> With no reliance on third-party plugins or platforms, your site will keep running smoothly for years—no surprise updates or maintenance required.</li>
    </ul>
